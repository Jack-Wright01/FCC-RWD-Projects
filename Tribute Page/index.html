    <h2>A timeline of Marie Curie's life:</h2>
    <ul class="timeline-list">
      <li> <strong>1867</strong> - Maria Salomea Skłodowska, later known as Marie Curie, is born in Warsaw, part of the Russian empire at the time.</li>
      <li> <strong>1883</strong> - Maria wins a gold medal as a top student after completing her secondary education, Her father loses his savings due to bad investments and so Maria finds employment, first as a teacher and later as a governess. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronis%C5%82awa_D%C5%82uska" target="_blank">She finances her sister Bronislawa's medical studies</a> in Paris, France.</li>
      <li> <strong>1891</strong> - Maria moves to Paris to study at the Sorbonne and begins to use the name Marie. She studies to complete her degree in physics and maths. </li>
      <li> <strong>1894</strong> - Marie meets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Curie" target="_blank">Pierre Curie</a> who is completing his doctorate of science. </li>
      <li> <strong>1895</strong> - Marie and Pierre marry on July 25th. She takes her husband's surname. </li>
      <li> <strong>1896</strong> - A french scientist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Becquerel" target="_blank">Henry Bacquerel</a>, discovers that the element uranium gives off unusual rays of enerergy. He passes on his findings to Marie who begins to study this phenomenon which she later names radioactivity.</li>
      <li> <strong>1898</strong> - Marie and Pierre Curie discover two new elements, later named radium and polonium. Polonium is named after Marie's homeland of Poland. </li>
      <li> <strong>1903</strong> - Marie becomes the first woman in France to earn a doctoral degree after recieving her doctorate of science in June. In November, the Curie's share the Nobel Prize for physics for their discoveries and research in radioactivity. </li>
      <li> <strong>1906</strong> - Pierre Curie dies in a traffic accident. Marie takes over his professorship at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to teach there. </li>
      <li> <strong>1910</strong> - Marie's fundamental treatise on radioactivity is published. </li>
      <li> <strong>1911</strong> - Marie is awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry for the isolation of pure radium. </li>
      <li> <strong>1914</strong> - Marie and her daughter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ir%C3%A8ne_Joliot-Curie" target="_blank">Irène Joliot-Curie</a> devote their time to make X-Ray technologies during World War One. </li>
      <li> <strong>1922</strong> - Marie focuses her research on the chemistry of radioactive substances. </li>
      <li> <strong>1932</strong> - Marie helps open the Radium Institue in Warsaw, her sister is named the director of the institute. </li>
      <li> <strong>1934</strong> - Marie dies near Sallanches, France. Her death was the result of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation. </li>
      <li> <strong>1944</strong> - A new element is discovered by American chemists, they name it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curium" target="_blank">curium</a> in honour of Marie and Pierre Curie. </li>
    </ul>
